## Introduction

The ${\tt fqar}$ packages provides tools for downloading and analyzing floristic quality assessment data from [www.universalFQA.org](www.universalFQA.org). Two tidied sample data sets, ${\tt missouri}$ and ${\tt chicago}$, are also provided.

Functions in this package fall into three general categories: _indexing functions_, which obtain tidy data frames of current public databases and FQAs from various regions, _downloading functions_, which download the FQAs themselves, and _tidying functions_, which convert downloaded assessments into a standard format.

## Indexing functions

Each floristic quality assessment is tied to a specific databases of native plants that has been compiled by experts in local flora. A listing of all databases accepted by [www.universalFQA.org](www.universalFQA.org) can be viewed with the ${\tt download\_fqa\_databases}$ function.

```{r}
databases <- download_fqa_databases()
head(databases)
```

To see a listing of all public floristic quality assessments using a given database, use the ${\tt download\_fqa\_assessments}$ function.

```{r}
missouri_fqas <- download_fqa_assessments(database_id = 63)
head(missouri_fqas)
```

Similarly, the ${\tt download\_fqa\_transects}$ function returns a listing of all public transect-level assessments.  

```{r}
missouri_transects <- download_fqa_transects(database_id = 63)
head(missouri_transects)
```

## Downloading functions

Floristic quality assessments can be downloaded individually by id number or in batches according to specified search criteria using the ${\tt download\_assessment}$ and ${\tt download\_assessment\_list}$ functions, respectively. 

The first of these accepts an assessment id as its sole input and returns a data frame. For instance, the Grasshopper Hollow survey has ${\tt assessment\_id} = 25961$ according to the listing obtained using ${\tt download\_fqa\_assessments}$. The following code downloads this assessment.

```{r}
grasshopper <- download_assessment(assessment_id = 25961)
```

Multiple assessments from a specified database can be downloaded simultaneously using ${\tt download\_assessment\_list}$, which makes use of ${\tt dplyr::filter}$ syntax on the following variables: ${\tt id, assessment, date, site}$ and ${\tt practitioner}$. For instance, the following code downloads all assessments by practitioner Justin Thomas.

```{r eval=FALSE}
thomas_fqas <- download_assessment_list(database = 63,
                                        practitioner == "Justin Thomas")
```

For even mid-sized requests, this command may run slowly due to the limited speed of the [www.universalFQA.org](www.universalFQA.org) website. For this reason, a progress bar has been added to the ${\tt download\_assessment\_list}$ function when $n\ge 5$. 

As the name suggests, the output of ${\tt download\_assessment\_list}$ is a list of data frames. 

```{r}
class(thomas_fqas)
length(thomas_fqas)
```

Transect-level data data stored on [www.universalFQA.org](www.universalFQA.org) is accessible to analysts using the ${\tt fqar}$ package via the functions ${\tt download\_transect}$ and ${\tt download\_transect\_list}$, which work exactly like their counterparts, ${\tt download\_assessment}$ and ${\tt download\_assessment\_list}$.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rock_garden <- download_transect(transect_id = 6875)
kaintuck <- download_transect_list(database = 63,
                                   site == "kaintuck")
```

## Tidying functions

The data frames obtained from these downloading functions are all highly untidy, respecting the default structure of the website from which they're obtained. The ${\tt fqar}$ package provides tools for efficiently re-formatting these sets.

Each floristic quality assessments on [www.universalFQA.org](www.universalFQA.org) includes two sorts of information: an inventory of species observed during data collection and summary information about the assessment as a whole. The ${\tt fqar}$ functions ${\tt assessment\_intentory}$ and ${\tt assessment\_glance}$, respectively, extract and tidy this information.

For instance, the following code creates a data frame of species found in the 2021 Grasshopper Hollow survey downloaded earlier.

```{r}
grasshopper_species <- assessment_inventory(grasshopper)
glimpse(grasshopper_species)
```

A tidy summary of the assessment can be obtained with ${\tt assessment\_glance}$. The output is a data frame with a single row and 53 columns, including ${\tt Native Mean C}$,  ${\tt Native Species}$, and ${\tt Native FQI}$.

```{r}
grasshopper_summary <- assessment_glance(grasshopper)
names(grasshopper_summary)
```

The tidy format provided by ${\tt assessment\_glance}$ is most useful when applied to multiple data sets at once, for instance in the situation where the analyst wants to consider statistics from many different assessments simultaneously. The ${\tt assessment\_list\_glance}$ function provides a shortcut when those data frames are housed in a list like that returned by ${\tt download\_assessment\_list}$. For instance, the following code returns a data frame with 53 columns and 61 rows, one per assessment.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
thomas_summary <- assessment_list_glance(thomas_fqas)
# warnings are appropriate but should be addressed
```

The ${\tt fqar}$ package also provides functions for handling transect-level data. ${\tt transect\_inventory}$, ${\tt transect\_glance}$, and ${\tt transect\_list\_glance}$ work just like their counterparts, ${\tt assessment\_inventory}$, ${\tt assessment\_glance}$, and ${\tt assessment\_list\_glance}$.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rock_garden_species <- transect_inventory(rock_garden)
rock_garden_summary <- transect_glance(rock_garden)
kaintuck_summary <- transect_list_glance(kaintuck)
```

Additionally, transect-level assessments usually include physiognometric metrics like relative frequency and relative coverage. These can be extracted with the ${\tt trasect\_phys}$ function.

```{r}
rock_garden_phys <- transect_phys(rock_garden)
glimpse(rock_garden_phys)
```

## Data sets

Two tidy data sets of floristic quality data are included with the ${\tt fqar}$ package, ${\tt missouri}$ and ${\tt chicago}$. Produced with ${\tt assessment\_list\_glance}$, these show summary information for every floristic quality assessment using databases 63 and 149, respectively. These sets may be useful for visualization or machine-learning purposes. For instance, we might consider the relationship between richness and native mean C in sites assessed using the 2015 Missouri database:

```{r missouri plot, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(missouri, aes(x = `Native Species`, 
                     y = `Native Mean C`)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(trans = "log10") +
  labs(x = "Native Species (logarithmic scale)",
       y = "Native Mean C") +
  theme_minimal()
```
